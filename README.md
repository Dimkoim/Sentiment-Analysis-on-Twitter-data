# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data

For the course "Pattern Classification and Machine Learning" at EPFL, we worked on sentiment analysis over twitter data. This project was a competition hosted by Kaggle : https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/epfml-text/

## Results

For this project, we used 10 neural network models over two set of features (5 models on each): 
- `Pre-trained embedding`: The first set of features used 1-gram with pretrained word embeddings (GLoVE)
- `2-gram`: The second set of features used 1,2-gram features
